# Prasad Gite

**Building production-grade software systems that solve real problems.**

Backend engineer and product builder focused on scalable architectures, AI/ML systems, and shipping software that works at scale.

## About

I design and build software products from architecture to deployment. My work spans backend systems, AI integrations, and full-stack platforms—with a focus on clean code, reliability, and production readiness.

I approach engineering as a craft: every system I build is designed for maintainability, observability, and scale.

## Engineering Principles

- **Production-first** — Code ships to real users, not just demos
- **Clean architecture** — Separation of concerns, testable modules, clear boundaries
- **Observability** — Logging, metrics, and monitoring from day one
- **Reliability** — Graceful degradation, error handling, and fault tolerance
- **Performance** — Efficient queries, caching strategies, and resource optimization
